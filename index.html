      Spotlight 8|16 If you enjoy watching films in English, you’ll have noticed that actors use words, phrases and forms of construction that are not only unfamiliar, but also difficult to translate. What is happening to English? Does it still follow the rules we learned at school?

      Bill Clinton was the central figure in the biggest sex scandal in US presidential history. But he still ended his presidency as the most popular US president since the Second World War. Clinton is from Hope, Arkansas. His father died before he was born, and his stepfather was an aggressive alcoholic. Clinton once told 60 Minutes, “I think the fact that I was born without a father and that
      I spent a lifetime trying to put together a picture of one also had a lot to do with how I turned out.” Clinton went to Georgetown University and Yale Law School, where he met his future wife, Hillary. He joined the Democratic Party and became the attorney general of Arkansas and then governor of the state. In 1993, he was elected the      42nd US president and remained so for two terms. Recently, he has been supporting Hillary in her campaign to become the next US president. Bill Clinton will be 70 on 19 August
